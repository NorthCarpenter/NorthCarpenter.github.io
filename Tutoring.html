 <p>I was born in St. Paul Minnesota and grew up in three different countries. I began tutoring in high school, and around the same time I was diagnosed with dyslexia and dysgraphia. I worked to help myself and my students find our own unique learning journeys. After graduating from the Anglo-American School of Moscow,  I attended Macalester College, where I received a BA in Economics and worked as a TA for three years. I moved to Berkely, CA for two years where I worked at Classroom Matters. There, I tutored students with a wide variety of learning differences in Math and executive functioning. I am currently located in Seattle where I am getting an MS in statistics from the University of Washington, Seattle. I continue to tutor individual students and small groups.</p>
 <p>My professional and life experience has taught me that learning is not one-size-fits-all, and that education often requires self advocacy. In my practice today, I focuse on encouraging questions, making material relatable, and building executive function skills. North enjoys getting to know his students and helping them achieve their goals. In his free time I can be found baking, running his Dungeons & Dragons campaign, going to art museums, and listening to history podcasts.</p>
