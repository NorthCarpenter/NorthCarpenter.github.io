    <p>Here are some spreadsheets I've made.
        <br>
        This sheet is designed to analyse the outcome of an AMPTA mock trial tournament. The sheet was originaly created at the Universtiy of Arisona by several authors. It was modified to work for 10 person teams by Dan Burgess at Macalester College. I added team scores, score deviations, and explinations to the sheet.
