    <p>Here are some spreadsheets I've made.</p>
    
    <p>
         A few years ago I found myself wanting to track my own expenses. I did not want to give away my spending data or give some app centralized access to all my accounts. This lead me to Google AppSheets whitch alows you to turn a spreadsheet into a sleek simple app. I use this to log my finantial data on my own private spreadsheet and automatical analyse and budget with it.

    <p>Here are a few screenshots form my app.</p>
     <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <img src="assets/Menues.png" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <img src="assets/Form.png" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <img src="assets/Cal.png" alt="Mountains" style="width:100%">
        </div>
    </div>

        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HhQMYNJav0S6VZxe5BqvHvj35fBpMH_dc7YmV9uPXfg/edit?usp=sharing">This sheet</a>
         is designed to analyse the outcome of an AMPTA mock trial tournament. The sheet was originaly created at the Universtiy of Arisona by several authors. It was modified to work for 10 person teams by Dan Burgess at Macalester College. I added team scores, score deviations, and explinations to the sheet. Here is a public copy.
